                            CPUs are important for running your computer. This piece of hardware is what runs non-graphical calculations for your computer.
                            CPUs also give instructions to the other parts of your computer.
                            Two things to keep an eye on when researching CPUs are the number of cores and the clock speed. Each core can operate separately
                            from the others; this allows for multitasking.
                            There is a digital way of multitasking known as threading that breaks up the physical cores into digital segments. Clock speed is the speed at which your computer can get individual tasks done.

                    <h2>Moore's Law</h2>
                    <p>
                        Moore's law is the trend of the number of transistors on a circuit doubling every two years. Transistors are what make up the ones and zeros that a computer reads.
                        Transistors do this by turning on and off a small electrical current that runs through it. This trend has held up to the test of time.
                        A major thing to consider is when will the law be broken? When will we reach the moment when computers are already as small and efficient as possible?
