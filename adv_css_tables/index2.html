            <p>
                Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is the second movie in the original trilogy and was released in 1980. This film is darker and more mature than A 
                New Hope was; most consider The Empire Strikes Back the best film in the original trilogy. The Empire Strikes Back beat Jaws at the box office;
                Steven Spielberg bought an ad in Variety congratulating George Lucas on his success. In this film, we see more focus on the Force
                and its' philosophy. Yoda appears in this film as Luke Skywalker's mentor and guide to the ways of the Force.
                The film ends off with no resolution; the resolution is found in Return of the Jedi. John Williams delivers yet another brilliant soundtrack.
                The scope of the Battle of Hoth, while not as large as the space fights, do still provide a sense of size.

                <p>
                    Star Wars: A New Hope is the first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. This film was revolutionary for 1977; its'
                    special effects and music was outstanding for the time. The editing process was extensive and very important for the success

            <h4>The Empire Strikes Back</h4>
                <p>
                    The Empire Strikes Back is the second movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. This movie is darker and grittier than the last
                    and is more designed as the first part of a story instead of being a standalone film. The film is considered by most to be the best film in the original trilogy.

            <h4>Return of the Jedi</h4>
                <p>
                    Return of the Jedi is the final movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. This is generally the most criticized of the trilogy
                    because of the Ewoks slowing the pace down of the film. Most believe that this film is better than the Star Wars prequels.
