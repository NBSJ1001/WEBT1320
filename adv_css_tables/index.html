            <h2>Star Wars: A New Hope</h2>
            <p>
                Star Wars: A New Hope released in 1977, becoming a blockbuster film. The film took inspiration from the Flash Gordon serials
                and Dune. It also went through various rewrites and remasters to reach its' current state. The visuals and sound design were groundbreaking
                for the time. A New Hope was designed around being a standalone film. The film is an escapade from reality which can be seen with the very little
                time given towards emotional scenes: the death of Luke's parents, beyond the initial moment, doesn't get any real emotional
                moments. The same can be said with almost every death in the movie: there is no mention of the emotions they must be feeling
                beyond the single moment they get.

                The comedic relief character C-3PO is fairly decent, especially if compared to Jar Jar Binks in the prequels. The movie is a classic
                zero-to-hero story. One of the things this movie did that made unique is the rough, beat-up technologies; this provided a more realistic enviroment
                rather than make everything hyper-modern and advanced like Star Trek. Luke Skywalker offers us a character to symbolize with: a young farm boy who dreams of better and more important things.
                He dreams of exploring the stars and becoming something more than a farmer. The film's production cost was 40 to 45 million US dollars in today's inflated currency.
                The editors did an amazing job moving around the scenes to make them fit well with each other. This film started off the whole Star Wars
                franchise: let's see how the next film expands on the world and story.

                <ul>
                    <li>A point of debate among fans is who shot first: Han Solo or Greedo.</li>
                    <li>In the original film, Han Solo not only shoots first but Greedo never fired his shot.</li>
                    <li>In the 1997 remastered film, Greedo shoots first. Solo dodges the laser and fires back.</li>
                    <li>The reason this change was made was because George Lucas felt that the scene made Solo appear less heroic. </li>
                    <li>This, among many small changes, is why some fans just want a better resolution version of the original 1977 film.</li>

            <h4>Star Wars: A New Hope</h4>
            <p>
                Star Wars: A New Hope is the first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. This film was revolutionary for 1977; its'
                special effects and music was outstanding for the time. The editing process was extensive and very important for the success
                of the film.

            <h4>The Empire Strikes Back</h4>
                <p>
                    The Empire Strikes Back is the second movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. This movie is darker and grittier than the last
                    and is more designed as the first part of a story instead of being a standalone film. The film is considered by most to be the best film in the original trilogy.

            <h4>Return of the Jedi</h4>
                <p>
                    Return of the Jedi is the final movie in the original Star Wars trilogy. This is generally the most criticized of the trilogy
                    because of the Ewoks slowing the pace down of the film. Most believe that this film is better than the Star Wars prequels.
