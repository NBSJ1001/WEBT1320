        <h2> History of Pixar </h2>
        <p>
            Pixar originally started as Lucasfilm's Computer Division in 1979; in 1986, Steve Jobs purchased the divison and made it an
            independent company named "Pixar". Pixar and Disney begin their work together and create "Luxo Jr."; the short film introduces
            the titular character that squishes the "I" on the Pixar logo animation. In 1991, Pixar begins working on the first Toy Story; on
            November 22, 1995, Toy Story released to astounding success, becoming the highest grossing film of the year. After releasing many
            more movies including A Bug's Life, The Incredibles, and Toy Story 2, Steve Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006 for over 7 billion 
            dollars. Pixar's history is one of quality animated movies with characters and worlds that entrance us with emotional impact.
            Let's see if Pixar's future holds the same quality of films.

        <h3>Pixar's Movie Design</h3>

        <p>
            Pixar films tend to always be hits with very few exceptions. Pixar has many creative movie ideas from an old man flying off in his house using balloons to toys coming to life all the way
            to monsters scaring children for an energy source. Most Pixar characters tend to be relatable from a human perspective;
            Pixar films manage to create realistic responses to events such as love stories or secrets being revealed that the average person would understand.
            Examples of this include Wall-E and Up. Wall-E is a film that focuses
            on showing the audience through the actions of the characters their love, not focusing on dialogue to reveal it. While later on, the human
            side of the story features some exposition, Wall-E focuses on a wholesome silent love story, showing us the emotional romance
            with no true need for spoken words. Up's famous love story sequence is a big part of what makes the film so popular and memorable.
            It goes from childhood to death in a span of under five minutes; it starts from when they get married and shows how the lost of a loved one can cause someone's life to deteriorate, but also shows us you
            can still enjoy life.
